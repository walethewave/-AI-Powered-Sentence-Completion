# 🎮 AI-Powered Sentence Completion for Video Game Texts

Welcome!  
This project is a showcase of my passion for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**, applied to the vibrant world of **video game narratives**.  

As an AI engineer, I wanted to explore how modern NLP techniques can be leveraged to **understand**, **predict**, and even **generate** contextually relevant text—specifically within the creative and emotionally rich domain of video game writing.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Video games are more than entertainment—they’re **interactive stories**, **emotional journeys**, and **complex decision systems**.  
The language in games shapes player immersion, emotions, and engagement.

> **But what if AI could co-create, analyze, or even extend these narratives?**

This project investigates that possibility by building a robust **sentence completion model** trained on a curated dataset of diverse video game texts.

### 🌟 Project Goals

- Predict the **next word** in a sentence given its context  
- Auto-generate new, plausible **game-related sentences**  
- Demonstrate how **classic NLP pipelines** can still solve creative real-world problems  
- Show how emotional tone in narratives can be modeled for **emotion-aware text generation**

## 🛠️ Project Overview

### 🔗 Data Source

- Custom, hand-curated dataset of **video game-related texts**, annotated with **emotional context** for deeper modeling.

### 🔄 Pipeline Breakdown

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing
   - Punctuation removal
   - Tokenization
   - (Optional) Stopword filtering

2. **Dataset Creation**
   - Sliding window to create **5-word input sequences** with the 6th word as the prediction target

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - **TF-IDF vectorization** for meaningful, sparse representation of text

4. **Modeling**
   - **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for next-word prediction  
   - **Top-5 candidate sampling** for diverse and human-like sentence completions

5. **Sentence Generation**
   - Auto-generates plausible, grammatically correct game-style sentences based on partial inputs

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Deployment (Planned):** Streamlit

## ✨ Key Achievements & Learning Outcomes

- ✅ Built a **full NLP pipeline** from raw text to sentence generator  
- ✅ Designed a **custom dataset** capturing emotional nuance and game-specific context  
- ✅ Developed a sentence generator using **probabilistic sampling**  
- ✅ Demonstrated effective use of **TF-IDF and Naive Bayes** in creative NLP use cases  
- ✅ Modularized code for **scalability and experimentation**

## 📊 Example Workflow

```python
# Example: Create training pair
["video", "games", "have", "evolved", "into"] -> Target: "a"

# Vectorize text
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus_df.Sentence)

# Train model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict next word
predict_word("video games have evolved into")
# Output: 'a' or similar

# Generate sentence
generate_sentence("game is good to play")
# Output: 'game is good to play and the to a gaming the and the...'

## 📝 Example Generated Sentences

Here are a few samples generated by the model to showcase its creativity and contextual understanding:

> **Input:** `the hero must`
> **Output:** `the hero must find the lost sword`

> **Input:** `after the battle`
> **Output:** `after the battle the village was silent`

> **Input:** `choose your weapon`
> **Output:** `choose your weapon wisely before the fight`

## 📚 Dataset Summary

A glimpse into the emotional depth and style variety of the dataset:

```text
"the princess waited in the tower"         [emotion: anticipation]
"victory was bittersweet for the hero"     [emotion: bittersweet]
"the city lights flickered in the rain"    [emotion: melancholy]
```

* **Source:** Extracted and curated from game scripts, lore entries, and fan fiction
* **Emotional Labels:** Annotated to allow **emotion-aware predictions** and future mood-driven generation
